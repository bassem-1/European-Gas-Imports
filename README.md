## Background
With the growing demand for natural gas in Europe, accurately predicting import volumes is crucial for optimizing supply chain operations. This project leverages statistical methods to provide insights into future import trends.

## Data
The dataset used in this project consists of historical daily natural gas import data for various European countries. The data is sourced from [insert data source here, e.g., a government agency, market report, etc.], covering the period from [start date] to [end date]. The dataset includes:
- Date
- Country
- Daily import volumes

Make sure to replace the placeholder with the actual data source and dates.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Statsmodels**: For time series modeling (ARIMA).
- **Scikit-learn**: For model evaluation metrics.

## Model Implementation
The ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model is used for forecasting. The steps taken in the implementation include:
1. Data loading and preprocessing.
2. Performing the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test for stationarity.
3. Plotting ACF and PACF for determining ARIMA parameters.
4. Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
5. Fitting the ARIMA model and making predictions.
6. Evaluating the model's performance.

## Evaluation Metrics
The model's performance is evaluated using:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R-squared (R²)
These metrics provide insights into the accuracy of the predictions.

## Conclusion and Insights
Concluding Insights
- **Predictive Power**: The ARIMA model effectively forecasts future natural gas EU imports by leveraging historical data and capturing temporal relationships through lagged values.
- **Key Markets**: Analysis focused on major suppliers like Russia and Libya, highlighting the impact of their import fluctuations on European gas supply dynamics.
- **Stationarity**: Achieving stationarity through differencing is crucial for accurate time series forecasting, emphasizing the importance of data preprocessing.
- **Model Evaluation**: Metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) demonstrate the model's effectiveness in capturing import patterns.
- **Strategic Implications**: Accurate forecasts provide valuable insights for traders and policymakers, aiding in decision-making and supply chain management in the commodities market.
- **Future Work**: Future research could enhance predictive accuracy by integrating additional variables and exploring hybrid models that combine ARIMA with machine learning techniques.
